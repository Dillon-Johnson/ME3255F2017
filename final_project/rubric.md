# Grading Rubric

| Component | Grade | Description |
| --------- |------ |--------------------------------- |
|Solutions | 50 % | Problems are solved correctly and solution makes sense |
|Documentation| 30 % | All files have comments and all functions have help files |
|Problem Statements | 10% | Descriptions of each problem and the approach |
|Team Work | 10% | Each group member made commits to repository|
|Github Bonus | 5% | If a group member opens an [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) and you commit code to close it|

The Documentation and Problem Statements will be assessed based upon the included m-files
and the main README.md documentation. This is a final report, so make sure the README.md
is easy to understand with headers (`#`, `##`, ...) to start each problem and sub-problem. 

The Solutions will be graded based upon correctness and the approach. The plots will be
graded based upon the axis labels, titles, legend, correctness, and design.
If you are asked to solve for a value, you can choose to put it in a table or in a
paragraph, but it must be easy to read/understand.

The Team Work section is meant to demonstrate working knowledge of Github (now as a
collaborative project). If everyone makes commits to the project, then you will receive
credit. 

The Github Bonus requires extra reading. Create an issue and tag your group member. That
group member can then respond and *fix* the issue with a commit. This is a bonus 5pts (on
an individual basis, for everyone to get credit, everyone in the group would need to close
an issue)
