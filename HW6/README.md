b. with Euler's method

c. with Heun's predictor-corrector approach

**3\.** Solve the initial value problem with y(0)=1, y'(0)=0

y''+9y=0

a. analytically

b. with Euler's method

c. with Heun's predictor-corrector approach

**4\.** Solve the freefall problem for x(t), given cd=0.25 kg/m, m=60 kg, from t=0-12 s,
given x(0)=100 m, v(0)=0 m/s

v'=g - cd/m v*v
